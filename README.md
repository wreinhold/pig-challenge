# pig-challenge

This was the result of my final project for my Python coding class at Bocconi University. In it, I was tasked to create a game where users could play against a computer opponent or another human. 

This pig game allows the player to select from 4 opponents with different strategies or play against a human.

They are allowed to then roll a dice, adding that number to their total. If they continue to roll, they risk losing all of their points from that round if a 1 is rolled. The player goes back and forth with their opponent until one of them reaches 100.

This project utilizes the random library and defines several functions that call each other throughout the game.
